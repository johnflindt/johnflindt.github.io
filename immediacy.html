And it was        quite        unfair. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>And also it was        very exhausting,        even for I know someone in the audience was exhausted, because they        said. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Just from watching        it. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>And yeah maybe it would        be good for me to see        what that’s like, to have my works used by someone else without being        criticised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">I        suppose Ben sort of created the role for himself, to try and, I think he        felt that        he needed to keep things going, or sort of coax you into giving more,        but I        mean, I don’t think you ever told him that’s what he needed to do.<span          style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;          </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">No I        didn’t<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">So,        maybe he felt that because of being a member of staff or, being older,        or being        a man or whatever. Or that he would have found it literally too        uncomfortable        if he hadn't geared it towards, and he'd stayed passive. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Well        afterwards he said to me "It looks like your tutor had made you do        it" and he also said that he had to do too much of the talking but after        a        while I was thinking I don't think he made me do it, I think I made        myself do        it by putting him there. So I made myself do it through him, which yeah        comes        into the ethics. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Ok, so        you used him to force yourself to do it? <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah which        is kind of like, well I did talk a bit about Rancier in that        conversation and        it was a kind of like an ignorant schoolmaster thing. Getting the        student to        speak.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yeah I        was interested in that, I've not read the text. But that was in your        dissertation as well?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yes throughout        the ignorant schoolmaster he talks about how students should learn how        to speak        spontaneously on any topic and to get over himself and not be        embarrassed. An        ignorant schoolmaster is a teacher who leaves out their own knowledge        when they’re        talking to a student and it isn't about them passing things on it’s just        about        keeping them on track and just guiding them and making them do their        work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is kind of what        Ben was doing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">I think        that tact is probably used by a lot of the tutors here. They're not very        prescriptive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Do you think        this is        getting you to, what did you says earlier, to just talk?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">What        to get over yourself?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What        this        situation right now?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yeah<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah        well any situation when somebody makes me speak I have to get over        myself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Do you        think that dynamic happens in peep show?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Oh        yeah, well I have a kind of like, well there aren't that many of them        but I        made a little book of all the speeches they do. The one when Jeremy gets        married        to Nancy for Visa reasons, it’s not a real wedding but Mark has to give        a best        man speech and he doesn't really want to do it and he hasn't prepared,        but for        Jeremy he has to do a speech. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">But        maybe that's through Jeremy’s incompetence rather than Rancierian        ignorance? <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">I        don't know, what is the difference?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yeah        that's a good point. And that’s what you were saying was that you felt        he had        this intelligence that maybe wasn't conscious that he was able to do        these        things through his body. You seemed perhaps, jealous. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">What        Jealous of Jeremy's body?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Well        not in those exact terms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah        I am a bit actually.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Jealous        of certain traits that he has. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah        how did you describe his intelligence just then? <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">It was        unconscious. He's not thinking, "oh the way I can get Mark to do a        speech        is by me not being able to do it” he just can't do it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;          </span>But maybe someone who was consciously doing        that would have already thought, “let's get mark to do the speech,        that'd be        good for him, so I wont prepare one” But maybe actually they'd be doing        that        just because they didn’t want to prepare one anyway. Or could but they'd        find        it really hard so they didn't want to. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">I do        have a problem with saying that Jeremy isn't intelligent. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The        point Rancier is making in the ignorant        schoolmaster is there is no such thing really as people having different        levels        of intelligence, it's really just class.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;        </span>That's exactly what class is. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>I        had another look at my dissertation the other day, well I can't really        read it because        it's embarrassing but the way that I was trying t liken Jeremy to the        ignorant        school master is by talking about the best man speech that Jeremy does        for        Superhanz which I think is kind of like an alternative to a coming out        speech,        but that’s not what Jeremy’s doing at all. He’s doing a speech but as a        way of        avoiding having to do that. And obviously no one knows what he's talking        about        but like normally if you came out by speaking that's like a really clear        declaration,        whereas Jeremy's is really unclear. And so like Rancier says that things        like        social order are based on explication because social order isn't natural        you        have to explain it. You have to just keep explaining to people why        things are        how they are and explication is also what he's trying to get away from        in        education so an ignorant schoolmaster doesn't explicate things. It’s not        like        the teacher is explaining to you some knowledge so you have it. I think        that relates        to Jeremy because he isn’t not being able to explain because he's        inarticulate        he is also avoiding having a clear identity and that is another kind of        classification.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Does that        make sense?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yes        well I suppose maybe not explicating directly what something is about        but going        about it in this roundabout way, that maybe he does in his speech. <span          style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>I        feel like is I kind of how art works maybe,        if you see what I mean? You don't just give someone your artist        statement or        what you think your work is about, because you can’t articulate it. So        you do        it through something else, through the work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">I do        have a problem with that though, I've realised really, because you're        kind of        saying you're using your work to articulate something that you can't        just say,        so you think your work articulates that instead? <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yes but        that doesn’t mean that someone would actually be able to read that from        it, or        that I would.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It means that        it is in the        work but it doesn’t always mean that it can be pulled out of it, or        maybe you        can't pull it out of it at the time, maybe later on you can sort of, you        know        you look back on this and you're like oh ok I get what that was about        now. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Either you or Ben said        that maybe you worked        at the edge of incompetence <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yes        at the edge of my competence which is what I mean about having a problem        with saying        I'm doing my work to articulate something because I'm more interested in        it        still being exactly what I can't articulate in itself, as like an        extension of        what I would say.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">So your        work isn't actually articulating anything?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Well        I think it does<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">No I        don't mean that in a negative way, I mean is that your desire for it? I        mean        everything articulates something <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah.        I guess I'm saying it from a position of just enjoying ideas and not        really        wanted to necessarily make an argument or be coherent or resolve        anything,        which is exactly the kind of way that Rancier writes. In the ignorant        schoolmaster        he talks about not trying scientifically to prove that people have equal        intelligence you just assume that it is true and then see what can        happen and I        think that’s what I’m interested in just deciding that things are going        to work.        <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">That        kind of reminds me of what Lawrence Weiner said in the conversation        between him        and Sharon Hayes where he talks about Racism and where if you realise,        or        decide that everyone’s equal you don't have to have racism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah        and he says if you're not racist it makes you free to be yourself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yes        exactly. So in the crit about your work with Ben you said that you were        reminded, or perhaps felt that there was a similar dynamic between their        conversation        and your piece?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah        there's a lot of differences but the reason why I said that is I think        to do        with the problem that in that video Sharon Hayes and Lawrence Weiner        basically        agree on things but then they have different language, like you said        Lawrence        Weiner calls something immediacy that Sharon Hayes calls subjectivity. <span          style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>And        also politically what you know about those        artists and the context that they work in, is that Sharon Hayes is to do        with        feminism. It's kind of how I feel when I talk to Ben. This is really        quite weird        to record, but it's fine I'm just struggling a bit. It reminds me of us        because        it's Sharon Hayes that brings in these questions of subjectivity and        actually        in the ignorant schoolmaster that isn't talked about at all which I        found        interesting, like gender or race don't come into it at all and in my        dissertation I was like picking bits out of it where you could actually        relate        it to some feminist or queer theory. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">So do        you think your work, because your work isn't obviously feminist, but        that's        just maybe a place that you come from, does that make sense? <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">In terms        of your thinking and your standpoint, but then your work becomes, I        don't        really know what your works is about. Discourse? <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yes I        wouldn't really want it to be put in a category, well I think that piece        actually        was one of the most obviously feminist pieces I’ve done in a way,        because of        the conversations it bought up to do with the canon, which wasn't how I        had put        it into words before I made it but I’m glad that came up so much. Which        kind of        comes back to the thing about me being irresponsible. I think we talked        about        this in one of the crits we had about it, like what position I was        saying who is        Joseph kosuph from because I obviously know.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;        </span>But it kind of sounded naïve, do you know what I mean?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yes,        Dave was saying that it was brave to put this mask of ignorance on for        the        work, but I felt that, I mean obviously it's tainted by me knowing you,        or        maybe you don't know Joseph kosuph as well as I thought you did? <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah        I don't<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Which        meant that I was reading things from the work, but that's to do with my        immediacy or my subjectivity right?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Well        that's really important for your work to be able to do things that you        didn't        know already<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Exactly.        But you also said at some point, that it could have been Lawrence        Weiner, which        I objected to strongly because I felt that they have completely        different        relationships to text, and art, and sculpture and that whoever it was        that you'd        mentioned, with my immediacy of, you know being a bit obsessed with        conceptual        art, that I then read all these things, they become parts of your work        and how I        interpret it. And I suppose with it being Kosuph I immediately        interpreted your        work as being about an idea. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah        I only said Lawrence Wiener because I was trying to think of another man        who is        as famous. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">It works        for those aspects of the work definitely<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Well        you could accuse Joseph kosuph of certain things and I think you should,        but        the work was about more than that. Like I said about the cannon it's not        just about        joseph kosuph, and however he might behave, more like making a personal,        I        don't know - like of course everyone who is here knows about the day we        spent        talking to Joseph kosuph, but of course the piece exists outside of here        so        other people who see it aren’t going to know about that anecdote<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">No        they're not, but some of them wont actually know who he is, but that's        their        immediacy isn't it. What I liked about, and maybe I only liked it        because I was        on the inside of it, but when you did the conversation with Ben for your        performance,        or lecture you mentioned on first name terms other students and their        work, I        think you said something about Vanessa and then you mentioned… <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">I        mentioned Nick as well<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">You mentioned        Nick as well which was really hilarious, but only for certain people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah        but if I'd done that performance in a different place then I would've        made        different jokes, or talked about different things. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Because        of the context?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah.        Why do you keep saying immediacy is that because it's a new word that we        learnt        from that video and you like it? <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yes        it's a new word that I like<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">But        do you like it more than subjectivity?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">It        feels more immediate than subjectivity. I don't think they are actually        interchangeable.        <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">I was        just going to say can we look at the quote<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">The quote        that I've written down? He says that, I can't remember if he said that        he        wanted to change people’s logic patterns or their thought patterns <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah        he definitely says that<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">But can        you remember which pattern it is that he wants to change?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">No I        can't remember<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">But I        suppose I think of subjectivity as being a lot about your experience in        the        past as well as in the present and maybe immediacy implies that slightly        less?        Or maybe it's that he's not really interested in any of the writers or        the discourse        that happened around subjectivity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah        I'm just wondering why he's not interested in it, I guess it’s not a        problem to        him <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Well        he's quite stubborn about wanting his work to be the same,        internationally, in differently        places. To have the same thing. It was interesting when he was talking        about        Sharon Hayes performances where she is talking on the street, and he        said that        he felt that you immediately then jump to conclusions about the        situation and        the person speaking and the power dynamic and he felt that it was street        theatre. But she rejected that it was theatrical. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yes because        she says that the people who see it don’t have access to a genre called        street        theatre but what they do have is political speech, they're much closer        to that.        <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">The        quote that I wrote down from Lawrence was, "I'd like to make art that        the        grandmother, the mother, the son all looking at it at the different        stages that        we talked about has a use for it that has to do with their immediacy and        the        only way to do that, is to essentially, sometimes leave out things" But        I        was really interested in the idea of leaving out things, leaving out        enough        things that then it becomes something that everyone can relate to, can        get something        out of. And maybe your work left a lot out, how much do you think you        leave out        of your work?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">I        think I leave out most things. I always feel like it's a bit of a        miracle when        I actually have something there so I've missed out most things. Maybe I        feel        the same as what he is saying. I think my work is just some stuff that        is there        right? And this becomes a problem, like you saying when Sharon Haye’s        does a        performance it brings in power dynamics because of who she is. Is that        what he means?        Because for me it is to do with identity and I’m really reluctant for my        work        to be to do with my identity, but then also sometimes it’s a really good        way of        dealing with certain things, using my work for that. But I think that my        work        exists outside of it because it's literally just some stuff, but then if        I'm        doing a performance then that's just not true anymore is it? Because        it’s my        body; and I find that really difficult.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">I think        things are always to do with identity, but they can be in a way that, by        them        being about your identity they’re then about everyone else’s identity,        so I        suppose that is were the leaving out comes in. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yes. Have        you been to the Bhabak Ghazi?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yes I        went<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Because        there's a really interesting thing in one of the essays in the show        which talks        about how he's reluctant to talk about biographical details, but he        leaves        traces of his desire through the things that he's photographing so he        isn't in        the work, but then by looking at the things that he has an interest in        you could        actually know a lot about him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yes he        is also always in the work, he’s positioned as the viewer when you're        looking through        the photos. I really liked the show and I read some of the essays. I        liked it,        but I'm not sure what I think about him taking pictures of all these        girls but I        suppose that's kind of what the work is about and I liked one of the        essays that        talks about him referencing the Prince song “I wanna be your girlfriend”        where Prince        wants to get so close to this girl that he feels the only way he can do        that is        by being her girlfriend, rather than her boyfriend.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;          </span>And I was wondering what you thought about        that. Also all the girls are quite similar. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Well        first I just want to say, I'm quite obsessive about remembering my        favourite        exhibition and this is my favourite show I've seen about 2.5 years and        funnily my        top 3 are all men. That's really bad. But my work is kind of about men        not        women actually and the last one was also a problematic man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Who was        that?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">It        was Jordan Wolfson<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">I don't        know his work <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">But        that's a whole other story.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I        just want        to say, what I love about, so there’s the essay that has specifically        been commissioned        for the show. That talks about, I think it was in this one that says        he's reluctant        to have an adult identity and do the things that people think of as        being successful        adult things. He's more like an adolescent which is totally what I like        about        Jeremy as well and it's something that I think about quite a lot myself,        but of        course he is an adult and I think his work is irresponsible. but then I        really        enjoy that. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yeah        why should you make your work responsible, I don't think art should be a        - it        shouldn't be too ethical. I really liked the way you'd go through some        of them,        and it would just be the same photo and you just weren't really given        anything        for quite a while and the layering of the photos and the folders I        thought was        brilliant. Yes the essays were really good. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yes        so what was that quote to do with Prince, because I think that is really        important <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Ok,        well one of the essays, in discussing that it was a show by a male of        mostly        photos of females she was talking about Prince's song “I wanna be your        girlfriend”        because I think he'd used that in one of the folders. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">I        don't know that song<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Ok well        I mean you don't need to know anything more about it apart from that        that's the        name of it, and that Prince is a straight man, because he's incredibly,        I mean        he wears heels but he's also very masculine, or very heterosexual but he        does        it in this interesting blurred way so maybe it's an interesting,        framework to        look at Bhabak's work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">That's exactly      what Bhabak is like though, I don't know him well but he is a man that      loves      women. That's why I like that. Bhabak does in this particular way that I      think      is really nice. <o:p></o:p></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Maybe        we should go back to another point of reference. What do you feel about        an exhibition        in an art school about art schools with another art school?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">That's a good question,        well you mentioned this earlier        but I can't remember the exact brief for this exhibition. It was to do        with the        art school being a site or an idea, I can't remember what else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yes        there was something about it as an idea, a site, and something about the        discourse which is the bit that made me really think about you, well I'd        actually been thinking about having a conversation with you as a way to        make        more work before deciding that it could be for this because I was quite        interested in talking to you about how I really thought that it had to        be        Joseph Kosuph. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah        still explain this more; you need to teach me more about Joseph Kosuph.        <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Well I think,        Joseph Kosuph is art as idea as idea as idea. That's the most important        bit for        him, it is this linguistic thing but him and Lawrence Weiner are sort of        chalk        and cheese in that Lawrence Weiner sees his work as about materials, he        sees        himself as a sculptor but Kosuph isn't really interested in that he's        interested        in the ideas of art, he feels that the most important bit about a work        is what        it does that other art hasn't done. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>And
so        for me you do things in order to have a conversation about them        afterwards. Which        I feel is Kosuph like, in a way. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">There        is quite a lot I want to say about this but I'm going to do a terrible        thing of        quoting Carl Andre because I love this quote, he is talking about this        exhibition        he's been invited to do outdoors and he says that when he gets there he        might        not have any ideas for outdoor sculptor but if they did a symposium he'd        be        willing to explain why he couldn't do it, and I just think that is so        great to        not even make the thing but to just have a symposium about it. When we        where        talking about Rhiannon’s work with Dave we talked about power and how        much, for        example how much time you take up speaking at a dinner party and it is        similar        to taking up space. And for a while I was thinking about sculpture being        to do        with taking up space and then I realised recently like of course that's        not        really the problem now what it is more about is taking up time in        situations. Like        who are the people on a panel doing a discussion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">In terms        of how they get chosen?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Maybe,        like an all male panel discussion would be a problem, and that's more to        do        with time than space, but actually aren't space and time the same thing        anyway.        And also of course speaking is a material thing I just think that        relationship        is interesting, does that make sense? Like that problem of male        sculptors        possibly translating into something to do with speaking?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Which        is interesting in relation to Lawrence Weiner, is that what you're        saying?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yes because        he says his work is sculpture. And I would also I suppose, I think the        objects        I make are there so that I can have the discussion, like a kind of        support,        like what supports do you need to talk? Well one of the things I        literally had        was some water because you need that when you speak for a long time, if        you do        a lecture you always have some water, but also it is things to do with        agency,        and Rhiannon said something interesting about how I created some agency        for        myself by not revealing by the end of the discussion what I actually        wanted to        say. But people where still listening so there was a power dynamic        because I        had this information but no one else had it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yeah        one of my favourite things about your lecture was that you kept saying        that you        where bored of talking about these things, whereas actually I wasn't        bored of        them and I think most people three weren't or might not have even talked        to you        about them earlier so they really wanted to get to a kind of punch line,        which        you never provided. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Which        is funny because that just made me think surely that is how teachers        feel? Bored        of the stuff they teach all the time because they have to do it every        year. And        also I was thinking a lot about how you said that piece was so Beckett        even        though I hadn't read any Beckett to refer to, like that Keith Arnatt        piece        where he said his contribution to the exhibition was nothing, well of        course it        wasn't actually nothing because that was written on a pieced of paper        but what        are those things around it that make doing nothing possible like that        talk was        kind of about nothing but what where all the things around it? And I am        interested in ideas to do with, like did you see that image that was        going        around a lot on the internet, I saw it a lot on Facebook by a women        artist who        made this little picture that said girls own the void and then it was        like silence        doesn’t belong to you and then it had a picture of a John Cage piece        crossed        out, I think there was a Bas Jan Ader piece, I didn't recognise any of        the        others<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">No I        didn't see that, which Bas Jan Ader? <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">I        don't know actually I only know that it was him because I saw that        someone said        that it was him, but I don't know the piece. And I think she's saying        that she        finds it annoying when men, so like people like John Cage or there’s a        really        good essay about John Cage and Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns called the        “aesthetic        of indifference” which talks about, which tries to argue that their work        is a-political        because it was so blank. So anyway this artist who made this piece would        be        annoyed about men using the void as a thing in their work because she        thinks        that belongs to women, but not just women </span><span style="color: red;">I        mean it would be to do with not being white as well I think, and        being someone who is silenced and actually so like what Dave said about        who        takes up time in a dinner party. I guess I find it funny because a lot        of        people who do have the power to speak say a lot of really stupid things        and I        find it quite funny to put myself in that position where people will        watch me        do a performance and I'm just going to ramble, or I might not really say        anything because why not? I think that is really funny.</span><span style="color: black;">        <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah        I think the talking most and power thing is true, but I think it is        quite        problematic, I mean this is kind of what your really long crits were        about, enabling        people to speak, because it's a social skill being able to talk the        most. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Oh so        many things come into it. Not just your gender it's really complicated.        <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yes        and it doesn't always mean that is the person that should have the        power. Did        you hear about the thing Maria was doing with Oreet Ashery, I went to it        on        Wednesday and we were in the student bar with all the lights off and t        she        played an audio recording, at first it was her talking, I thought she        had        written this text, and then other people were speaking, Bo and Caley and        two        others, <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Oh I        think Alice might have done that <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yes        Alice and Amber. And at the end I fell asleep, but it was really good. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">You fell        asleep?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">I mean        it was half an hour in the dark and I had to run to get there on time,        but        basically they were re-enacting, or enacting an October round table from        1993        with Hal Foster, Benjamin Buchloch <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Why        didn't I go to this? <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">It was        amazing, Benjamin Buchloch, Miwom Kwom and an artist that I can't        remember the        name of, Rosalind Krauss. They were just talking about the things        October        people would talk about and there had been a big show in France I think        and        some of the people thought that it was from now, and that the show they        were        talking about was the conceptual art show across the road. But Maria was        saying        she had edited things out in order for people not to know straight away        what        the text was from, so that they could relate it to their immediacy. But        all the        voices were female. I suppose this was in my work a bit, with the        conversation        with me and Bo. I'm really interested in when something gets transcribed        and flattened        out what you can get from it in terms of the identity of that person.        Because        they were reading a transcription, so the original round table has        already been        flattened out</span><span style="color: black;"> there's        no Mmm's and Ahh's pauses and natural things that happen when people are        having        a discussion and then that is read as a script which gives the recording        this slightly        odd feeling. But she had wanted to have two guys and two girls, but none        of the        guys, including me, replied to the email. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">So in this        piece where the voices are recorded, so you're saying it was all female        voices.        I find that kind of interesting. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Was        it all female voices? Because it depends on what point in the work you        place        the idea of the voice. Maria was Hal Foster, was that a female voice?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Well        maybe you would say she was reading not speaking? Which is similar to        the        Sharon Hayes show. I went to a talk that she did at the show</span><span        style="color: black;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">The        show at Studio Voltaire?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yes she        said that the people in those videos were readers not speakers, because        it is        not their words that they are saying. And she also said that through her        editing she had written it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">So        she edited the texts that became their scripts?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Well        she selected it, which is a kind of editing isn't it? And she made the        videos. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">I’m        interested in what the difference is. A lot of people had said about my        work        that it was a text that I wrote, but I didn't really feel like I had        written        it. I had edited it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yeah could        you say something about the process that the text went through? <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">So        the text was half a transcription of Bruce Mclean's film, and then half        a        transcription of me and Bo talking about that film, and then they are        cut        together, literally cut together in a William Burroughs, Bryon Gysin        way, and        the only editing I did was when two words met and then you are not quite        sure        which word they should be so you have to decide. So I didn't feel like I        had        written it, it felt like it was transcription or I felt like it was a        body of        text. I'm not quite sure how it came into being but it did. Maybe that        is        because when I do write things it is a process that I find quite        difficult, I        find it rewarding but I feel like you go into a certain space when        you're        writing, and I hadn’t gone into that space writing that text. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Can you        explain what you mean by that space that you go to when you write?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Well        I think writing is a little bit traumatic, but maybe it is just me that        finds        it this difficult. My dissertation used a lot of Blanchot who says that        writing        is like entering the space of death, and there is this particular essay        where        he </span><span style="color: red;">talks about the        myth of Orpheus and he says that writing or literature and the act of        writing        start from the point of Orpheus's gaze when he turns to look at Eurydice        but        she is still in the underworld, so that to write you kind of have to go        into        this space. Simon Critchley has written a lot about that as well through        Blanchot, and through his work on suicide, that to write is to occupy        the space        of death.</span><span style="color: black;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Whenever I have      to write something<span style="color:black"> I feel like my brain does        this        thing where, that is why I asked maybe we are talking about the same        thing but        where, it is really hard to describe it is like it becomes impossible        for me to        just say something because I start thinking about how I feel like        writing is        supposed to be. I realised lately that paragraphs are really annoying        because        why should you used them, and erm I realised this kind of because I read        an        essay that Saffira wrote and I read it 3 days before our dissertations        were        due, but of course by that point I still hadn't even transcribed my        dissertation from speaking it so I still didn't really have a        dissertation so        there was still a lot of decisions to be made anyway. And I read this        essays        that Saffira wrote and it completely changed how I think about writing,        and I        think it is really nice reading the essays of people you know because        then you        know the person that it is coming from. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Thern        you have a voice to project<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yes        and I just find it really fascinating to think that it was their body        who wrote        it, and you know it. I read this essay and, actually in the essay it        talked        about how having to write essays makes students be compared to each        other,        because it is the same format, and also grades they compared to how        money        compares things that are different. And it is just the same kind of        thing        basically. But I couldn’t believe how expressive the essay was because        whenever        I write an essay I never, well now I am going to try and be able to do        this but        I've just never been able to just write down this stuff that I would        say, and        it reminds me of in the Simpsons, you know that one when Bart is signing        people’s        yearbooks? I can't remember what he writes but this girl is like “he        writes how        people talk”. And it made me think of that. And then <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">I said        I don't know how you can write so authentically, or just how you would        say        things, and then Saffira said, “I think what you have to do is not be        scared of        your reader”. I thought that was nice <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yes definitely        I feel like when you're writing en essay you feel that you need to write        in a        certain way, because we could have done this whole thing over email or        something but it would have been completely different. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Then        you would have to think about sentences. And this is a problem with the        performances I've done, like that one recently where I don't know how to        preserve it because I think the stuff we talked about in the performance        is        much more interesting than what you would get from just looking at the        objects        so maybe I should write an essay or something.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">But you        wouldn't consider recording it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">No        because like I said I think the performance should be different wherever        it is        done because it is a different context, and I want to be able to respond        to the        audience. And if I did write it down then that would just be one        example, but        then I feel like that would set it into a particular thing too much, but        how        I've started to think about these kind of objects that I've been making        is that        they refer to a kind of set of ideas that have come together at a        certain time.        But the ideas aren't in the stuff so… I mean if I wrote it now it would        be different        to the stuff I said in that performance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">What,        if you wrote an essay to accompany that piece?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yes        but it is just a problem because I don't know how to make the ideas        available        to people now, but maybe they don't need to be, but I like the idea of        not        having a portfolio actually. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">In that        you'd just talk about it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah        I mean like to just do something and then just move on and not have to        say this        is all the work that I have done. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Or for        people to have preconceptions about how your work functions?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah But        then maybe the objects are just like some kind of residue of the        performance,        which is fine as documentation, even though I made them before the        performance.        <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">But I        feel like the objects are a residue of your process and your ideas. I        think art        is always a residue from something. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Do        you think this conversation is going well?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yes, well        it is longer than I expected, but I quite like that. The one I did with        Bo was        20 minutes but I like the idea that maybe if this exists in a space that        the conversation        is longer than anyone would spend in that space. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Well        the one with Bo was longer than that. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Well        yes I mean it was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">How        long has this been so far?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">This        has been an hour and 8 minutes <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Well        you see I don't think that is that long<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Well It        is not that long but <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">I        feel like we've just started to talk about everything <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Ok well        we'll carry on. Ok 20 minutes it was longer than people spent in that        space, especially        at a degree show but it is accessible as an amount of time, if you want        to feel        that you've seen everything. And I suppose this was in Bhabak's show, I        don't        know about you but I didn't open every single file, or see every single        page. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">No I        didn't but I was at the private view and I want to go back. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">There        wasn't really a need to look at it all but it also becomes slightly        exhausting.        <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">And        also it becomes about, what do you want to look at that is there? Like        how he        has photographed these women. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yeah        your desire from the titles, and then sometimes they don't give you        anything as        to what you expected. But I like the idea that if this conversation        existed in        time as a durational piece, in some way that it would be longer than you        would        comfortably be able to engage with it, so that there is always something        out of        reach. That has to be filled in by, you. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Can        you give an example?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Well        I'm still thinking about the folders that I didn't open. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">I        mostly read the essays<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">And the        essays that I didn't read. And I like the idea of it being at different        times,        different for different people depending on what point they engage with        it. In        a way what it does is it leaves things out, like we were talking about        earlier.        Being longer than you can experience comfortably or by there being more        stuff        than you can experience comfortably almost does the same thing as there        not        being that much stuff at all. I've got the invitation to exhibit, so        maybe we        could read this, "staff and students are invited to submit work for the        exhibition. Exhibited work will be primarily but not limited to moving        image        and projection. The selected work for the exhibition will present a        range of        responses to the art school as a place, an idea, a community and a set        of histories,        or as an architectural site”.</span><span style="color: black;"> </span><span        style="color: red;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">I        forgot that it said architectural site, but then it also says idea, I        think        since I read that I was thinking of it being a site in the sense of,        well I        guess that is what it means by it being an idea like. My problem with        that is        how the idea of the art school can be used for different purposes, such        as art        fairs and biennials and things like artworks or just the things that go        with        the artworks that are using structures or the image of a school, like        doing a        seminar or lecture or something but that could be, well you could use it        for anything        you want to do in a way, but I think I'm more interested in education        now that        is not to do with an institution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Well it        is one of those briefs that enables any work to go into it, which is an        incredibly        art school thing. I'm not quite sure what you mean about the art fairs        and        seminars. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">What        I'm talking about is what people call the educational turn where        education, I        can't talk about this well which is really stupid because I should be        able to        by now but I still don't really understand what I’m saying. Just how        education        is to do with funding I guess as well. How you have to prove that people        will        participate in an exhibition and then after that then educational work        has come        out of that as well. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">How do        you think, well I think I've asked you this before actually, how do you        think        your work will function now you're not in an educational institution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Well        I think I’m going to make a piece in September actually for a show that        Flora        is organising and I realised it is in September which is significant        because It        is going to be my first September where it is not a new school year. For        how        many years, I don't know when do you star school? When you are like        four, so 18        years, so It is going to be my first September I don't go back to school        and I        want to make some kind of ritual or something. I think it is going to be        weird,        like you know when you go back to school every September and I think it        is much        more significant than it being a new year in January, it like resets        you. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yeah I        mean I'm still thinking about this being the summer and then in October,        ok so        what am I going to be doing in October? But it is completely arbitrary        now. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah        but I don't think I will be able to get away from that, but in a way I        think I        really should be able to, because, or like I need to because there are a        lot of        things that are more important than school, and erm yeah this is a        really new        idea I've had in the past few days I’m not really sure what it is yet        but like        we were talking about work being sculptural and how Lawrence Weiner’s        work he        says is Sculpture, and I think my work is something to do with sculpture        as        well and to do with the material of stuff. So at the same time as me not        going to        school anymore I have started to become really interested in Buddhism        and I was        watching a video the other day on YouTube where this guy was talking        about how,        and this conflicts with how I think about ideas being a material thing,        because        they always come from material things and your brain is a material        thing, I        guess I believe in materialism, but this Buddhist guy was talking about        how he believes        that mind comes before matter, I can't really explain it. It is really        horrible        being recorded when you are struggling; do you know what I mean? <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yeah<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Because        normally it would be ok. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Do you        think this conversation is going well?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I don’t know it’s      not really for me to say.<o:p></o:p></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">I don’t        think it is for anyone to say.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">No        but like you are making a piece of work. Like how Ben said that he did        too much        of the talking in my piece, but I think it was an ok piece from my point        of        view. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">I don't        think conversations should have a particular hierarchy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah        I guess that is the point of doing a conversation. But when I make a        piece I am        always trying to just get it to the point where it is ok. In terms of my        criteria. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">So what        are your criteria?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">I don’t        think I can really say, but…<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Some        kind of resolution?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">No        no, no definitely not. More like that I would want it to be thick        enough. Like        do you think the content of this conversation has been…<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Thick?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">At        times, yes. When you asked me that earlier I was thinking your talking a        lot        more than I thought, or maybe I feel like you are talking more than I        am. But        I'm not sure if that is to do with power, it almost feels like I'm        interviewing        you. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah        there are moments where it felt like that. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">I think        particularly at the beginning but I suppose it's hard to find a way to        start,        so I thought I'd find a way to start, and then I couldn’t think of        anything to        say. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Oh so        do you think that is a failure of the conversation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">What is        a failure of the conversation?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">The,        well it doesn't really seem like we have been equal, not that we have to        speak        the exact same amount of time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">The conversation        never had anything that it needed to do, there's no way that this can        fail        because the only criteria was that we would talk, for me anyway. I mean        we were        silent for quite a while, if you'd wanted to suddenly start asking me        questions        you could have done that, but I suppose like you say I'm the one who has        initiated this as something to do with my work, so I suppose you        probably have        the feeling at the beginning to sit back a bit and see what        preconceptions, or        what ideas that maybe I have as to how it should function. And then I        probably        felt a responsibility, or I did feel a responsibility at the beginning,        for us        to start talking. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">But        when I'm in that position, like when I did that performance, I think I        just        said at the beginning, I said a very short and not very well thought out        thing        about Beckett, just so that I had started it, because obviously I was        responsible for starting it but then... <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Then        your duty was done. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah.        Well not completely but that was one of the main things that I felt like        I had        to do. Yes we've probably talked about my work too much but I can't        really help        it when someone wants to talk about my work, I love talking about it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Well I        am pleased that you've done all the talking. I quite like the idea that        you've        done all the talking, but that maybe it's my work. Which is because of        what you        said earlier that you liked the idea that you would get used for        someone's        work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">But        you're the one who has to do all the work to be able to say what the        work is, I        don't have to do it, do you know what I mean? <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">What        which work is? <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">This        piece of work, you have to do all the work to say how it is a piece of        work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Which gives        you a freedom, but I'm not going to have to write a report anymore.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">No        but your name is in a show then you have to… <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Well of        course. Maybe I was thinking about how I can move on from the last piece        and        having another conversation seemed like a logical way to move forward.        To think        that might become an important part of my work, because I suppose like        you were        saying earlier, the thing that gets made material, or gets put in the        show is        kind of a detritus to all the ideas and processes and everything that is        your        work really, so by having a conversation it almost allows you to put the        bubble        that is all those things, to turn it into…<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">You        know what I think, this conversation, not that it is bad in any way. You        know        how we just started chatting earlier when we were outside and then you        said we        should've just recorded it and I think conversations are always better        in a        grey space when you haven’t planned to have a conversation and I was        just        thinking how are we going to end the conversation, but we will probably        end it        when we've stopped recording, but actually that way of speaking is        probably        better than how we're speaking right now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yeah I        suppose maybe what I was trying to do to start was to tease us back to        the        conversation that we had outside, but of course that doesn't, that was        never        going to happen because we've both already said those things, like you        said in        your lecture, we've become bored of those bits so they are for us now        but not        for anyone else. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah        I find it really embarrassing to say things that I've already said. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">You        know what I just said about how it would've been better if we were        outside? We        are still in one of those spaces; we're in the canteen aren't we? Which        is an        informal kind of space to have a conversation in. Like after a seminar        or        something you'd be in the canteen and then you would have a better        conversation. But I don't like this room, I know it is empty now but        even        normally I don't think it is a good canteen for having those        conversations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">No it's        not. In a way it would have been better for us to have been in one of        the rooms        that normally isn't better for the conversations, in one of the rooms        that        something educational would take place in because it would have been        quieter,        smaller. But we're here; we're no longer part of the institution so we        don't        have access to those rooms, maybe that is important. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yes        that's true. I was just saying to Aram what they should do is have…kind        of like        in Bristol how they have the art school and then the studios right next        to it,        they should have studios for when you've finished being a student but        then you        could have a studio right there so you don't have to leave. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">It's probably        quite hard to get a studio at Spike Island though. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Yeah        I know but I’m just saying that was the example it reminded me of. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">What is        that noise?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">I        don't know. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">I don't        know any of their names<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">No I        don't, the only one I knew was Jason <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Which        one is that?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">The        one who left. I feel like even in this I have repeated myself, a lot of        stuff I’ve        said before but I guess that is what people have to do. And maybe it is        a generous        thing, not that I am being generous, but like a generous thing to do        with        ideas, if someone wants to talk about them to just talk about them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yeah        the people that I've seen give more than one artist’s talk, or see them        talk in        a symposium more than once they don't say anything new the second time.        <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">I        feel tired<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">You        feel tired, shall we stop?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">I        just wanted you to have the power to decide when to stop<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">That's        what I meant when I saId we would talk better afterwards. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">I        could write it down?<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yeah        write it down. <br>      </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><br>    </p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><br>    </p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><br>    </p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><br>    </p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><br>    </p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><br>      <span style="color: red;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>    <p style="margin-left: 324px;"><!--EndFragment-->    </p>  </body></html>

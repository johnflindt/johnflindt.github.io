have      you written down?<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"> </span>Cows lick,      Richard Burton Pimples — go to Harrods and buy the pimples. He kept      talking      about body pieces, all his friends where doing body pieces and pose      pieces.      Yeah pose pieces it’s Henry Moore, because he — I remember that’s the      period      that people get really influenced by Henry Moore right. Because he’s      referring      to his peers. Or maybe it’s a different time.<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"> </span>Yeah maybe. I was thinking more because he did that piece where      he’s like on the plinths, and it’s his body. Have you seen that? No<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">      </span>He’s just making poses on the plinths.      Oh, I think I saw a picture of it. Yeah, and I think he was sort of fed up      of      the big sculptors that he was being taught by, like at St Martins. Yeah      These      big Macho guys and he sort of wanted to break away from that macho image      of an      artist. Which I suppose in this there was so much attention on him, just      sitting there with the microphones trying to be important.<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">      </span>Yeah yeah, like having two, like there      is this image of him with the two microphones pointing really closely to      his      mouth and as if he’s you know giving out this really important monologue —      this      speech kinda thing. Yeah the guy asks him why there are two microphones      and he      just said, ‘it looks better to have two’. But they’re not plugged in right      —      it’s all about in the shadow of your smile Bob. Yeah yea and he was like,      yeah      someone’s asking about the plugging in and he was like ‘oh plugging in is      not      important’.<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"> </span>Why is the Iron      not      plugged in? ‘there wasn’t a plug handy’ doesn’t matter. But they’re poses,      all      these pose pieces, and he said he would’ve liked the cables to be posed      better.<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"> </span>Yeah didn’t he say      they’re not, yeah      doesn’t matter whether they’re working or not but they have to, like the      cords      and the cables need to be…<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"> </span>Yeah      so      it doesn’t matter but it would’ve been nice if they’d looked better.<span        style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">      </span>But these all, yeah, it’s like a      contradiction within it. With the posing, the aesthetics of the formal      quality      of it.<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"> </span>You mean the formal      quality      of the look of the artist, or — because he has a comment at the end about      how      ‘he’s a big guy’.‘Big guy Bob’‘Bob’s a big guy’ I don’t know his work that      well, the piece I always remember is, ‘The box with the sound of its own      making’ it’s just one of those things you see in conceptual art books, a      kind      of classic 60’s thing. <span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></span>I      just have this really vivid image of,      it was him on the sculpture actually I think, but it’s quite big, you know      —      angular boxy kind of thing. And he was standing next to it.<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">      </span>I was looking him up and he did this      show in the 70’s and as the poster to the show was him topless, he’s got      some      chains, like a gay fetish type thing. I can’t remember the name of the      show,      and that was the cover for it. It really surprised me. I don’t know maybe      he      was playing on the macho artist thing, because that’s post all this. I      think      Bruce Mclean told him he’d made a film about him but I don’t think he was      very      impressed. So he’s seen it?<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"> </span>I      don’t know if he’s seen it but Mclean said he went for a coffee with him      or      something and he was like, ‘oh I made this film about you’ but I don’t      think he      seemed very pleased. Yeah I think they where in a show together before      this, it      might have been the show where they were taking the photo of Bob looking      so      serious, which is what it’s from right.<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">      </span>I      just suddenly remembered this not really related fact that I know that      Yvonne      Rainer used to go out with Bob Morris. But this is off topic really.<span        style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">      </span>Is there more gossip to that?<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">      </span>Well Yvonne Rainer, subsequently — I      think she was single for a long time and then she starts dating a girl and      then      she said it was the most euphoric experience ever. I think she mentioned      something about I don’t know being very like Macho man.<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"> </span>What so after Robert Morris you have to get with a girl?<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">      </span>I’m not saying that. After Bob Morris      she has to go a long period of not seeing anyone and then decided that      seeing a      girl was better.<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"> </span>Maybe he      did that      cover to that show after they broke up.<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">      </span>Yeah      There is also some reference with Andy Warhol right? With the white? I      don’t      know I read somewhere that he was either referencing it or influenced by      it.      But I think it’s just the — that light and dark thing in ‘Chelsea Girls’ I      mean      I don’t think he wore a white suite everyday that’s deliberate isn’t it.      And      then the shadow of Bob’s smile and the white suite. But he said that he      really      liked Brancusi and Brancusi had said he found it hard to work in the      shadow of      Rodin’s smile — no, not the shadow of Rodin’s smile but the shadow of      Rodin. So      Mclean thought, it’s hard to work in the shadow of Robert Morris.<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">      </span>Yeah because you mentioned they where      in a show together and I don’t remember where I saw this but there was      this      catalogue where you know you have Bob Morris and then you have this huge      page      of just his exhibitions and stuff he has done, and then you have Bruce      Mclean.      I think he was still at St Martins then so just like…Two lines?<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">      </span>Two lines.<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"> </span>And then he was saying how, I think it came from a photo that he      took of him maybe. Oh the photo of Bob? I think maybe that was the photo      for      the exhibition, or the press afterwards, looking super serious, super      cool. But      the, the name he said he got the name from this Tony Bennet song. The Jazz      singer? <span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></span>I      don’t know but it was covered quite a      lot, and the first version was in this film ‘The Sandpiper’ with Elizabeth      Taylor in. So he’s not even got the, he’s got the name from somewhere else      but      the name was somewhere else before that. The whole thing is, the shadow of      your      smile, it’s Bob, It’s Andy Warhol. I wonder whether, like how he came up      with      the idea, like with the iron and the tape recorder?<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"> </span>Yeah I was wondering about that because the tape recorder kind      of makes sense doesn’t it, you’ve got these mic’s maybe it was being      recorded,      but I don’t think it was plugged in either. But the Iron is a bit random      isn’t      it. He said it was the college’s Iron I don’t know if he borrowed it, our      loan      store doesn’t have irons, maybe it does, textiles have probably got irons.      It’s      very domestic isn’t it?<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"> </span>Yeah      I      like the idea, didn’t he say something, the other person said ‘oh this is      your      film Bruce Mclean this is your film’ but he kind of was responding saying,      ‘oh      it’s about Bob Morris’ do you remember?<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">      </span>Yeah      he was like<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘oh my name is      not important      it’s about...’‘In the shadow of your smile Bob’ and then he said it’s      about Bob      Morris.Yeah I think he said that it was important to get it right so when      it      was on the film you don’t want it to be spelt wrong.<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"> </span>But did you feel like — because it’s about being in the shadow      of Bob Morris, but at the same time, I — yeah it’s like there is a layer      of      reference and more than the layer of — kind of taking the piss. I think      there      is an element of taking the piss, but I don’t think actually…It’s not      taking      the piss.<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"> </span>I think it’s more,      maybe      out of like,<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"> </span>Respect?<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">      </span>Not the right word — maybe, you know <o:p></o:p>Yeah,      it’s affectionate isn’t it?<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"> </span>It’s      a      positive thing rather than… Yeah it’s definitely a positive thing, I think      he —      he really did think it was hard to make work in the shadow of him. And I      think      all the humour in it — yeah it’s taking the piss but there’s a lot of      meaning      behind it. A lot of important stuff, like the pose pieces and the you know      oh      he goes ‘what’s that’ and he goes ‘oh that’s a switch, that’s a switch      piece’      it’s clever isn’t it, it’s really acute or intellectual about an awareness      of      what’s going on.<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"> </span>Yeah and it      feels      — I don’t know enough about what his immediate peers where doing, but it      feels      that, as you said he was like acutely aware of the dynamics of all these      superstar artists and you know coming from a generation after them and      making      work about it but then instead of — just kind of going after them.<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">      </span>Yeah because I think he was like that      when he was at St Martins, probably everyone else just wanted to be just      like      Anthony Caro or whoever was there. It’s quite a confident thing to.<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">      </span>Yeah<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"> </span>To do — to have that reaction to a whole generation of work.<span        style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">      </span>And I wonder whether the humour thing      is in a way a sort of — an act of, rebellion maybe? From the seriousness?      From      like the seriousness of the, ‘early one morning’ sort of important piece      of      work in the history of British sculpture. Because I remember in the thing      you      sent me he said something about, I don’t know whether it was him or      somebody      else, I think it was him, said, humour was really important because it was      as      close as it can be to truth.<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"> </span>Yeah
the      most honest truths are said in jest. I feel like he could have made a film      about everything he talked about, you know he said ‘oh I should make a      film      called cows lick’ there was just like this, he was kind of taking the piss      about making a piece about everything, but there’s also just this      saturation of      ideas and possibilities in the way he was thinking. You know it’s a really      fruitful time isn’t it, for art, there’s so much new things happening, the      possibility of what can be art. What other works by him? What are the      works      like after the 60’s and 70’s? I don’t know, I know now he’s making, I’ve      seen      photos of him making these potato paintings, they’re quite nice. I don’t      think      I’d go and see them, but I don’t know the humour is definitely still      there. I      find it interesting that know he just like — he might do other stuff — but      like      just paintings, it’s so traditional, but maybe that’s to do with age or to      do      with…Probably hard for him to get away from people thinking of him as, I      mean      like the plinth stuff, just an image that comes up so often. Robert Morris      is      still alive as well I don’t know what he’s doing. Is he still very active?<span        style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">      </span>I don’t know, Wikipedia said that he’s      living and working in New York, but he’s also eighty-something so I don’t      know      how much — working he does. Probably got a big studio. <o:p></o:p>    </p>    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>    <p style="margin-left: 325px;"><!--EndFragment-->    </p>  </body></html>
